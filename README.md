Voice assistants are software agents that understand spoken language and respond with synthetic voices. The most popular voice assistants are Alexa from Amazon, Crotona from Microsoft, Siri from Apple, and Assistant from Google. Specialized home speakers and cellphones both come equipped with these helpers. Users may ask their assistants questions, manage media playback, and operate voice-activated home automation devices, in addition to handling other basic tasks like email, to-do lists, and calendars with spoken commands.. The fundamental functions and typical characteristics of today's voice assistants will be examined in this essay. 
# About
Many of the devices we use on a daily basis these days are equipped with voice assistants, such as laptops, smart phones, and highly-qualified speakers. The widespread integration of AI into people's daily day to day lives is also accelerating the transition to voice. Among the most well-known voice assistants are Apple's Siri, Amazon Echo  (which is answers to the name as Alexa), Microsoft's Cortana, Google helper, and the newly released AIVA intelligent helper. With the help of Python, we have created a static voice assistant for this project that can send messages to a user's mobile device, copy and paste files across locations, and place voice commands to order pizza.
# Features
These days, voice assistants are already included in many products. In order to enable our assistants to handle the massive volumes of data being created these days and produce better outcomes, we must integrate machine learning into them and educate our devices based on their intended functions.. In addition to machine learning, other similarly significant technologies include big data access management, IoT, and natural language processing. Understanding how people come to trust virtual agents is becoming an important area of study as artificial intelligence technology advances to create smart devices. With the help of our investigation, we present a fresh approach to look at users' confidence in audio support throughout a search task utilizing virtual reality.
# System architecture
The Speech Recognition library, which is a key component of this concept's efficient implementation of a personal voice assistant, includes numerous builting-in functions that enables in the assistants to comprehend user commands and respond to them verbally, including Text to Speech capabilities. The voice command will be converted to text by the underlying algorithms when the assistant records it from the user. 
# Conclusion
Each of these features has a specific role to play in the overall operation of the system be provided by the user. When a user offers an input command by speech, the assistant hears it, recognizes the term, and performs a search. In the event that the assistant locates a keyword associated with the command, it will carry out the action as instructed and provide the user with the output in both text and voice through the terminal window. Should this not be the case, the assistant will once more await the user's accurate inputs. Each of these features has a unique roles of the overall operations done by the system.
